I want to build a simple Super Mario Bros–style platformer game in the browser using Kaboom.js. Please create a project with the following setup:

Project files:

index.html → load Kaboom.js and link to the game script.

style.css → simple styles (center the canvas, maybe a background color).

game.js → main game logic.

Game requirements:

Use Kaboom.js to initialize the game.

Add a player character (a simple rectangle or sprite placeholder).

Allow the player to move left/right with arrow keys and jump with spacebar.

Add gravity and a ground platform the player can walk and land on.

Create a simple level map with a few blocks and platforms.

Add at least one enemy (e.g., a moving rectangle) that the player must avoid or stomp.

Add at least one collectible item (like a coin) that increases score when collected.

Make the camera follow the player as they move through the level.

Extras (optional if time allows):

Add a basic score counter on screen.

Add simple sound effects for jumping and collecting items.

Organize code so I can easily expand the game with more levels later.

Instructions:

Include comments in the code explaining how each part works (so I can learn).

Keep everything beginner-friendly and avoid overly complex features.
